This repository is related to my project on Generative AI. In this project, I fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model using LoRa to generate paintings in the style of a specific artist. Here, you'll find the code for fine-tuning, the inference code, and a brief report on training the LoRa weights. 

The weights can be found here: https://huggingface.co/maxkochanoff/sdxl_lora_for_portraits/
